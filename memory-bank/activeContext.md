# Active Context

## Current Focus
Epic 1 — Complete End-to-End Request Management System ✅
Goal: Complete request submission, persistence, confirmation, and tracking functionality.

## Active User Story
US-010: Submit a public records request (COMPLETED)
US-011: Request confirmation and tracking system (COMPLETED)

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Given a user completes required fields, when they submit, they receive a tracking ID and confirmation page
- ✅ Given invalid input, field-level errors are shown and submission is prevented
- ✅ Given successful submission, request is persisted to Firestore with tracking ID
- ✅ Given a tracking ID, users can look up their request status and details
- ✅ Given different screen sizes, all components remain responsive and usable
- ✅ Given file attachments, users can upload and preview files

### Current Focus (Next Epic)
**Epic 2 — Agency Console & Staff Workflows**
- Request queues for staff review
- Status management and updates
- Department-specific filtering
- SLA tracking and due date indicators

## Technical Stack (Current)
- Next.js 15+ with TypeScript (strict mode)
- MUI v5+ component library
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Firebase/Firestore for data persistence
- date-fns for date formatting
- Responsive design implementation
- ESLint + Prettier configuration

## System Architecture
### Data Layer
- Firebase/Firestore for request storage
- Request service with CRUD operations
- Tracking ID generation system (PR-{timestamp}-{random})
- Support for multiple request statuses

### UI Components
- RequestForm: Complete form with validation and file upload
- DateRangePicker: Custom component with preset and custom date ranges
- FileUpload: Drag-and-drop with preview functionality
- RequestConfirmation: Full confirmation page with request details
- Status tracking: Lookup page for request status by tracking ID

### Pages
- `/` - Submit new request
- `/confirmation` - Request confirmation (with Suspense boundary)
- `/status` - Track request by tracking ID

## Recent Decisions
1. Firebase/Firestore for backend persistence (prototype-ready)
2. Tracking ID pattern: PR-{6-digit timestamp}-{4-char random}
3. Status workflow: submitted → processing → under_review → completed/rejected
4. Client-side navigation with window.location for cross-page transitions
5. Suspense boundaries for components using useSearchParams
6. Environment-based Firebase configuration with emulator support

## Current Capabilities
✅ **Complete Request Submission Flow**
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- File upload with preview and removal
- Date range selection with presets
- Successful submission with tracking ID

✅ **Data Persistence**
- Firestore integration with proper typing
- Request service with error handling
- Automatic tracking ID generation
- Status management system

✅ **User Experience**
- Confirmation page with complete request details
- Status lookup by tracking ID
- Navigation between all features
- Responsive design across all components

✅ **Technical Foundation**
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean component architecture
- Build optimization and deployment ready

## Next Priorities (Epic 2)
1. Staff queue interface for managing requests
2. Status update workflow for staff
3. Department-specific request filtering
4. SLA tracking and due date calculations
5. Request assignment and workflow management

## Dependencies
- Next.js 15+
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Material-UI v5
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Firebase SDK v10+
- date-fns v3+

## Notes
- Complete end-to-end user flow implemented and tested
- Firebase integration ready for production configuration
- All core UI components complete with proper testing
- Ready to begin staff/admin interface development
- Solid foundation for AI matching and document processing features
