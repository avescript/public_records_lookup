### Current Focus (Epic 2 Continuation)
**Next Tasks:**
1. **Implement request details view/drawer for status management**
2. Enhance SLA tracking with business day accuracy
3. Add internal notes and workflow management
4. Build request assignment and escalation features

## Technical Stack (Current)
- Next.js 15+ with TypeScript (strict mode)
- MUI v5+ component library with @mui/x-data-grid for advanced tables
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Firebase/Firestore for data persistence
- date-fns for date formatting and business day calculations
- Responsive design implementation
- ESLint + Prettier configuration

## System Architecture
### Data Layer
- Firebase/Firestore for request storage
- Request service with CRUD operations
- Tracking ID generation system (PR-{timestamp}-{random})
- Support for multiple request statuses

### UI Components
- RequestForm: Complete form with validation and file upload
- DateRangePicker: Custom component with preset and custom date ranges
- FileUpload: Drag-and-drop with preview functionality
- RequestConfirmation: Full confirmation page with request details
- Status tracking: Lookup page for request status by tracking ID
- StaffDashboard: Advanced data grid with SLA tracking and priority indicators
- AdminTools: Test data seeding and development utilities
- **PublicLayout**: Clean public interface with submit/track navigation
- **AdminLayout**: Professional admin interface with staff navigation and logout
- **ProtectedRoute**: Authentication guard component for admin sections
- **AuthContext**: Authentication state management with role-based access

### Pages & Routes
**Public Interface (No Authentication Required):**
- `/` - Submit new request (PublicLayout)
- `/status` - Track request by tracking ID (PublicLayout)
- `/track` - Redirects to `/status` for compatibility

**Admin Interface (Authentication Required):**
- `/admin/login` - Staff login page with test credentials
- `/admin/staff` - Staff console with request queue management (Protected)
- `/admin/tools` - Admin tools for development and testing (Admin-only)
- `/admin` - Redirects to `/admin/staff`

## Recent Decisions
1. **Public/Admin Interface Separation**: Clear separation between public requesters and staff workflows
2. **Mock Authentication System**: Development-ready authentication with role-based access (admin, staff, legal_reviewer)
3. **Protected Route Architecture**: Authentication guards for admin sections with automatic redirects
4. **Session Persistence**: localStorage-based session management for development
5. Firebase/Firestore for backend persistence (prototype-ready)
6. Tracking ID pattern: PR-{6-digit timestamp}-{4-char random}
7. Status workflow: submitted â†’ processing â†’ under_review â†’ completed/rejected
8. Client-side navigation with window.location for cross-page transitions
9. Suspense boundaries for components using useSearchParams
10. Environment-based Firebase configuration with emulator support
