# Active Context

## Current Focus
Epic 1 â€” Core UI Components & Form Implementation
Goal: Implement core UI components and form functionality for public records request submission.

## Active User Story
US-002: Public Records Request Form

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a user accesses the form, they can input request details with validation
- Given invalid input, appropriate error messages are shown
- Given valid submission, loading state and success notification are shown
- Given different screen sizes, the form remains responsive and usable
- Given file attachments, users can upload and preview files

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Create repo and Next.js + TypeScript + MUI baseline
- [x] Add ESLint + Prettier + TS strict config
- [x] Implement BaseLayout with Header and Footer
- [x] Create RequestForm component with validation
- [x] Add form state management and feedback
- [x] Set up FileUpload component with drag-and-drop
- [x] Fix TypeScript configuration and resolve errors
- [x] Implement proper project structure

### Current Tasks
- [ ] Add file upload preview and validation
- [ ] Integrate FileUpload with RequestForm
- [ ] Add department-specific form fields
- [ ] Create custom date range selector
- [ ] Add request status tracking

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js with TypeScript (strict mode)
- MUI v5+ component library
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Responsive design implementation
- ESLint + Prettier configuration

## Next Up
