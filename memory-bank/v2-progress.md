# V2 Development Progress

## Epic V2-0: Foundation & Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `feature/US-V2-000-foundation-migration`  
**Commit:** f075407  

### ✅ Completed Deliverables

#### Architecture Planning
- [x] **V1 Codebase Analysis:** Identified reusable components (StaffDashboard, RequestService, etc.)
- [x] **V2 Workflow Design:** 4-step guided process (Locate → Redact → Respond → Review)
- [x] **Routing Structure:** `/v2/request/[id]/{step}` with dynamic navigation
- [x] **Component Architecture:** Shared navigation, layouts, and step components
- [x] **Data Integration:** Connected to existing V1 StoredRequest interface

#### Code Foundation
- [x] **Directory Structure:** Organized V2 components and routes
  ```
  src/app/v2/
  ├── dashboard/page.tsx
  ├── layout.tsx
  ├── page.tsx
  └── request/[id]/{locate,redact,respond,review}/page.tsx
  
  src/components/v2/
  ├── dashboard/V2Dashboard.tsx
  ├── shared/{StepNavigation,V2WorkflowLayout}.tsx
  └── steps/{Locate,Redact,Respond,Review}Step.tsx
  ```

- [x] **Step Navigation Component:** Progress tracking, breadcrumbs, and step access control
- [x] **Enhanced Dashboard:** Request cards, quick stats, search, and filtering
- [x] **Workflow Layout:** Consistent structure for all step pages
- [x] **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Material-UI

#### Key Features Implemented
- **StepNavigation:** Visual progress bar, step status icons, intelligent navigation
- **V2Dashboard:** Card-based request display, status filtering, quick metrics panel
- **Workflow Foundation:** 4-step process with placeholder components ready for implementation
- **Seamless Integration:** Works with existing V1 data without modification

### Technical Achievements
- **Zero Breaking Changes:** V1 system remains fully functional
- **TypeScript Integration:** Proper typing with Next.js routing
- **Material-UI Consistency:** Maintains design system standards
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and loading states
- **Performance:** Minimal bundle impact with lazy loading

### Testing & Validation
- [x] **Build Success:** V2 compiles without errors alongside V1
- [x] **Route Validation:** All V2 routes accessible and functional
- [x] **Component Integration:** Step navigation and dashboard working correctly
- [x] **Data Flow:** Request loading and display functioning properly

## Next Epic: V2-1 Request Landing Page
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 weeks  
**Priority Tasks:**
1. Enhanced filtering system (status, assignment, keywords)
2. Advanced search with full-text capabilities
3. Quick metrics panel with activity timeline
4. Bulk operations (assign, export, status updates)
5. Request priority management

## Development Notes
- Foundation is solid and ready for AI feature integration
- V1 components can be gradually enhanced or replaced as needed
- Architecture supports both incremental migration and parallel operation
- Ready to begin user-facing feature development
