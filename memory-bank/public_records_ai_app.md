# Design Document (DD) — Public Records AI Assistant

**Environment:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
**Doc Owner:** [You]  
**Status:** Draft v1  
**Date:** 2025-08-27

---

## 1) Summary & Goals

This design specifies _how_ we’ll implement the PRD on **GCP**, focusing on a Google‑first stack (auth, storage, email) and an interactive **prototype** that uses a **dummy dataset** and publicly available APIs to simulate full behavior. The app supports intake, AI‑assisted record matching, redaction with human review, approvals/legal, and scheduled delivery.

**Objectives**

- Reduce turnaround time with AI‑assisted retrieval and redaction.
- Ensure compliance with public‑records statutes and PII protection.
- Provide full auditability and multi‑agency scale.
- Prototype quickly using synthetic data and mock sends, then graduate to real connectors.

- **A11y**: WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard‑first workflows.
- **PDF/images**: PDF.js viewer; canvas overlays for redaction (UI).
- **Testing**: Jest + RTL; Playwright for critical flows.
- **Perf**: Next.js image opt; code‑splitting; CDN; Core Web Vitals budgets.

## 3) Components

1. **Public Requester Portal** (public) — request intake, attachment upload, status lookup (phase 2), A11y AA.
2. **Agency Console** (internal) — queues, SLA views, AI match review, redaction UI, approvals, delivery scheduling, audit trail.
3. **Ingestion & Indexing**
   - **Prototype (simulate sources):** load synthetic corpora & public sample datasets into Cloud Storage; mock connectors emit realistic metadata.
   - **Future sources:** SharePoint/Exchange, Google Drive/Gmail, file shares/SFTP, case‑management DBs, email, on‑prem DBs, Azure, AWS.
   - Pipeline: fetch/ingest → normalize → OCR → extract → classify → embed → store → index (Matching Engine).
4. **Search & Match Service** — Hybrid keyword + semantic (Matching Engine). Filters: agency, date range, source, type, sensitivity. Confidence scoring + explainability.
5. **Redaction Service** — PDF viewer/editor (PDF.js) with suggestion overlays. DLP‑based auto‑detect for PII. Versioned outputs; 100% human review required.
6. **Approvals & Legal Review** — routed tasks, comments, diffs, sign‑off, rework loops.
7. **Delivery Service** — combine records into a single PDF (cover sheet + index); schedule via Cloud Tasks; deliver via Gmail API and/or portal links (Signed URLs).
8. **Admin & RBAC** — roles: Admin, Records Officer, Legal Reviewer, Agency Staff, Requester. Multi‑tenant isolation by `agency_id` (row‑level security in SQL).

## 4) Data Model (initial)

**Entities**

- `agency(id, name, domain, retention_policy_id, ...)`
- `user(id, agency_id, role, email, name, idp_subject, mfa_enrolled, ...)`
- `request(id, agency_id, requester_name, requester_email, description, received_at, due_at, status, sla_tier, category, ...)`
- `request_message(id, request_id, sender_type, body, created_at, attachments[])`
- `record(id, agency_id, source_system, source_id, title, mime_type, created_at, sensitivity, checksum, storage_uri, ...)`
- `record_text(id, record_id, ocr_text, docai_json, embeddings_vector, lang, ...)`
- `match(id, request_id, record_id, score, rationale, reviewer_id, decision, decided_at, ...)`
- `redaction(id, record_id, version, author_id, doc_uri, redacted_uri, dlp_findings_json, status, ...)`
- `approval(id, subject_type, subject_id, approver_id, status, comments, decided_at, ...)`
- `delivery(id, request_id, package_uri, method, scheduled_for, sent_at, status, ...)`
- `audit(id, actor, action, subject_type, subject_id, ts, ip, context_json)`

**Indexes**: btree on `agency_id`, `status`, timestamps; ANN index in Matching Engine; or `pgvector` in SQL for smaller sets.

---

## 5) AI Design

- **Retrieval**: per‑agency corpora with Vertex **Text Embeddings**; vectors in **Matching Engine**; metadata in Firestore/Cloud SQL.
- **Ranking**: hybrid BM25 + ANN semantic scoring; Top‑N + explanation (nearest‑neighbor distance + matched phrases).
- **Summarization**: Gemini compares candidate records to request; produces justification text.
- **PII Redaction**: DLP detects SSN, DL#, DOB, addresses, minors, health info, and other protected info; **100% human review** required before release.
- **Response drafting**: Gemini with legal templates (placeholders: request_id, date ranges, exemptions, fees); human approval required.
- **Safety**: no model training on agency data; prompts/outputs logged for audit.

---

## 6) Workflows

**A. Request Intake**

1. Public submits request → `request` created; SLA clock starts.
2. Classifier tags category, suggests due date; notification to queue.

**B. Record Matching**

1. Search service retrieves Top‑N by semantic+keyword.
2. Reviewer confirms/rejects; decisions logged in `match`.

**C. Redaction**

1. Selected records → OCR (Document AI) → DLP findings.
2. Editor shows overlays; officer applies/edits masks; versioned redaction saved; **human review mandatory**.

**D. Approvals**

1. Legal Review; comments, change requests.
2. Approval recorded; package locked.

**E. Delivery**

1. Combine as single PDF (cover sheet + index).
2. Schedule send (Cloud Tasks); **Gmail API** and/or **Signed URL** link; status updated; receipts/audit entries emitted.

## 7) APIs (selected)

```

## 8) Security & Compliance

- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Google Identity Platform (SAML/OIDC) + IAP; role‑based permissions; least‑privileged IAM.

---

## 9) Scalability & Performance

- Stateless services on Cloud Run with autoscaling; min instances for warm starts.
- Pub/Sub buffering for ingest/processing spikes.
- **Traffic assumptions**: ~**100 requests/month**, ~**3 records/request**, avg file **< 10 MB**.
- **SLOs (initial)**: Search P95 ≤ 2s (≤ 50k docs) and ≤ 4s at larger scale with Matching Engine; redaction viewer P95 ≤ 3s for ≤ 50MB PDFs; delivery schedule adherence ≥ 99.5%.
- Load testing with k6; traces verified via Cloud Trace.

---

## 10) Observability

- Cloud Logging, Monitoring, Traces, Error Reporting, OpenTelemetry.
- Logging sink to **BigQuery** for analytics dashboards.
- Metrics: request turnaround, match precision/recall, redaction edits per doc, approval cycle time, SLA breaches.
- Alerts: queue backlog, delivery failures, ingestion errors, latency SLO burn.

---

## 11) Deployment & Environments

- **Envs**: local (Docker + emulators) → dev → test → staging → prod.
- **Emulators (Phase 0)**: Firestore emulator, Pub/Sub emulator; mock wrappers for Vertex/DocAI/DLP for offline demo.
- **CI/CD**: Cloud Build + GitHub Actions; container image scanning; Terraform for infra.
- **Migrations**: n/a in Phase 0 (Firestore/Simulation); plan Flyway when moving to Cloud SQL.
- **Secrets**: Secret Manager + least‑privileged service accounts.
- **Audit export**: Logging sink to **BigQuery** dataset (e.g., `pr_ai_audit_us_west`).

---

## 12) Phased Delivery

- **Phase 0 (Prototype/Simulation)**: Google‑only stack; Firestore + Cloud Storage; simulated connectors; **Matching Engine**; **mock sends**; full interactive UI with no external source integrations.
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Intake, queues, hybrid search, DLP/DocAI suggestions, approvals, combined PDF, scheduler; single‑agency; Gmail + portal delivery.
- **Phase 2**: Multi‑agency tenancy; first real connectors (Google Drive/Gmail, SharePoint/Exchange); analytics; requester status portal.
- **Phase 3**: Additional connectors (file shares/SFTP, case mgmt DBs, on‑prem DBs, Azure, AWS); federated search; translations; eDiscovery.

---

## 13) Decisions from Open Questions

- **Requester portal sends (prototype):** **Mock sends only**; no real emails in Phase 0.
- **Dummy data scope:** **Multiple agencies (5)** — Public Safety, Transportation, Health, Corrections, Education.
- **Corpora realism:** Pre‑load additional **public‑domain government PDFs** (non‑PII) to boost realism alongside synthetic docs.
- **Audit logs export:** Allow export to **BigQuery** for dashboarding; retain app‑level audit table and Cloud Logging.
