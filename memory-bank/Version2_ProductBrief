# Public Records Request Manager — Version 2 (V2)

## Overview
V2 of the *Public Records Request Manager* introduces a guided, stepped process to streamline how government staff locate, redact, and respond to public records requests. The goal is to simplify the end-to-end workflow while improving accuracy, transparency, and efficiency through AI-assisted features.  

This version focuses on breaking the request response workflow into distinct, auditable steps — **Locate**, **Redact**, **Respond**, and **Review & Send** — with a redesigned **Request Landing Page** for easy navigation and task management.

## Objectives
- Simplify the request response process through a structured, step-by-step workflow.  
- Leverage AI to automate and accelerate record search, summarization, and redaction.  
- Provide transparency and accountability through audit trails, approval tracking, and clear status visibility.  
- Improve collaboration across agency staff, approvers, and records officers.  
- Establish the foundation for integrations with real data sources and communications in future releases.

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (mock database in V2; Cloud SQL planned for production).  
- **AI Functions:** Matching, summarization, redaction, and drafting via LLM endpoints.  
- **Storage:** Cloud Storage or simulated storage for records and redacted copies.  
- **Integration Targets:** Google Workspace (Docs, Gmail, Drive) and BigQuery for analytics.
